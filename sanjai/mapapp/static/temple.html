            The Main Deity here is known as Kailasanathar who is an incarnation of Lord Shiva. 
            His Consort is Karpagambal who is none other than Goddess Parvathi.
            Around 1300 years ago KIng Nandhivarman took keen interest and started building this Temple.
            The Presiding Deity in the form of a Shivalingam stands majestically 5 feet tall and is East facing.
            Goddess Karpagambal who stands 3 feet tall Blesses Her Devotees from a nearby separate Shrine.
            Though the Temple is not so big, it has a huge courtyard with various shrines for Vinayakar, Murugan, Maha Vishnu, Brahma, 12 Jyothirlingam, Vishnu Durgai, Gajalakshmi, Dhakshinamurthy, Nayanmars Hanumar, Chandikeshwar, Sarabeshwar, Iyyappan & Kaala Bhairavar.  
            Shrines for  Aakasa Lingam and Naga Devathai are found just outside the Temple.  Navagraha Sannidhi too is found.
            The entire Temple has a cement flooring with a compound wall.  This Temple has been provided manned security service throughout.
            The Thiruneer or the Divine Ash given to the Devotees is said to cure many ailments.
